# MoonPigTechTest
Thank you for having a look at this. While I am mostly happy with how this turned out and it's representation of my skills,
<br> there are still a couple things I would improve/work upon
<br><b>How I would improve this project:</b>
<br><br>1) I would remove the buttons and replace it with a search bar that the user could type into which would then filter the products based 
<br>on their description so the user would be able to type something like "father" and all father's products would appear.
<br><br>2) Instead of a "purchase" buttons I would like to have a basket button which would add the item to the user's basket. Every page 
<br>would have a check out button which the user could use to purchase mutliple items at once
